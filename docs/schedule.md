# Stark Orchestrator – Realistic Effort-Weighted Week Plan

| Week       | Tasks                                                     | Estimated Effort (sum of difficulty units) | Notes                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Week 1** | 1–2 Networking: Ingress + Service Discovery               | 3 + 3 = 6                                  | Very heavy, first block; might bleed into Week 2              |
| **Week 2** | 3–5 Networking: Load Balancing + Network Chaos + polish   | 3 + 2 + 2 = 7                              | Networking wrap-up; high cognitive load                       |
| **Week 3** | 6–9 Secrets & Security                                    | 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8                          | Medium-heavy, focus on TLS, RBAC, auditing                    |
| **Week 4** | 10–12 Persistence: PV abstraction, PVCs, snapshot/restore | 3 + 3 + 3 = 9                              | **Hardest week**; storage + chaos tests                       |
| **Week 5** | 13–14 Persistence wrap-up                                 | 3 + 2 = 5                                  | Polish rescheduling, cleanup; might extend if issues arise    |
| **Week 6** | 15–19 UI / Dashboard                                      | 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9                      | Medium week; easier than persistence but still time-intensive |
| **Week 7** | 20–23 Regression & Reliability                            | 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 9                          | Regression tests + metrics; medium-hard week                  |
| **Week 8** | 24–27 Optional / Advanced                                 | 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10                         | Only if core is solid; can stretch over multiple weeks        |
